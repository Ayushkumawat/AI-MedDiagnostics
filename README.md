# AI-MedDiagnostics

AI MedDiagnostic is a web-based application that allows users to track their symptoms and predict the likelihood of having a disease based on their symptoms. The application supports various diseases such as Dengue, Heart-Attack, Paralysis, Hypertension, Chronic Kidney Disease, Heart Disease, and COVID-19. Users can enter their symptoms into the application, and the system will use machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of having a disease. The application also has features like Personal Health Care Assistance, which provides personalized health care advice based on the user's symptoms, medical history, and lifestyle.

## Personal Health Care Assistance

The Personal Health Care Assistance feature allows users to get personalized health care advice based on their symptoms, medical history, and lifestyle. The system uses a machine learning algorithm to analyze user data and provide personalized advice on diet, exercise, and lifestyle changes to improve their overall health.

## COVID-19 Detection

The COVID-19 Detection feature uses machine learning algorithms to analyze symptoms and predict the likelihood of having COVID-19. The system takes input from the user about symptoms they are facing, including fever, cough, and shortness of breath. The input is then processed by the system, which uses a machine learning model to determine the likelihood of having COVID-19.

## Additional Features

- Chronic Kidney Disease Detection
The Chronic Kidney Disease Detection feature uses machine learning algorithms to analyze symptoms and predict the likelihood of having the disease. The system takes input from the user about symptoms they are facing, including fatigue, nausea, shortness of breath, and more. The input is then processed by the system, which uses a machine learning model to determine the likelihood of having Chronic Kidney Disease.

- Heart Disease Detection
The Heart Disease Detection feature also uses machine learning algorithms to analyze symptoms and predict the likelihood of having the disease. The system takes input from the user about symptoms they are facing, including chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, and more. The input is then processed by the system, which uses a machine learning model to determine the likelihood of having Heart Disease.
